### Hello 👋, I'm Yasin Akbulut.
  
Frontend Developer with experience in building **scalable** and **maintainable** user interfaces using technologies such as **React**, **Next.js**, **Redux**, **Saga**, and **Styled Components**. Skilled in translating **design systems** into clean, intuitive interfaces and delivering consistent user experiences across platforms.

At Jotform, a platform serving over 25 million users, I worked as part of the **Product team**, contributing to key features like **Push Notification**, **Copilot**, and **User Management** for the **No Code App Builder**, within a **monorepo architecture** shared across teams. I also took part in the development of Jotform AI Agents, creating dynamic email templates.

Outside of my professional role, I built and deployed personal web projects that generate passive income and strengthened my skills in end-to-end, scalable web development.
